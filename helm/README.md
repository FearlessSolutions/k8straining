## RBAC

To enable helm/tiller in an RBAC secured cluster, we will grant tiller a cluster-admin role/binding https://helm.sh/docs/rbac/

`kubectl create -f rbac-config.yaml`
`helm init --service-account tiller --history-max 200`


Current Issue: GKE permissions are weird, i can't actually get cluster admin right now. Not solving.

For demo purposes, just use the local cluster while editing the values.yaml for nexst2 response
